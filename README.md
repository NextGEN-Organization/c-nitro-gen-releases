# c-nitro-gen-releases
Public releases of our nitro generator. 
Currently does 50 million strings in 0.2-0.4 seconds on an i7 10750H base clocked at 2.6ghz.

# The binaries are under releases.
The code is currently private.
However, you can hit me up at [my discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NzSaAgFe) for more info.


## Disclaimer
This is using xorshift128. As such, this is weak randomness. 
While still random, I am not entirely sure if this properly reflects how nitro codes are generated.
I will release a nitro sniper that reports all USED nitro codes to me, so I can analyze their generation.
I need a large codebase to work with.
